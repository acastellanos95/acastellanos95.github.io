Hello, I'm Andr√© Castellanos. I'm a physicist and a Computer Science MSc student at CINVESTAV that loves problem solving and coding. I'm always learning new things because I love to learn. I have learnt many programming languages like: C++11, Python 3, C# and JS.

In my undergraduate studies I learnt and developed many typical numerical algorithms(root finding, derivation, integration, ODE) in C++ and FORTRAN. Then in my postgraduate coursework I learnt High Performance Computing which include distributed computing and parallel computing, I learnt also cryptography where I coded many encryption schemes and encryption algorithms and learnt also Security in Information Systems.
